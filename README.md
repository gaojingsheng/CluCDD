## CluCDD
This includes an original implementation of CluCDD:  Contrastive Dialogue Disentanglement via Clustering

## Get Started

- An effective framework for dialogue disentanglement. The model captures the utterances and sequential representations in dialogues.
- The contrastive training paradigm is employed to amend feature space, and a cluster head predicts the
  session number to enhance the final clustering result.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CluCDD is suitable for solving dialogue disentanglement and establishes the state-of-the-art on two datasets

## Setting Up

Our codebase requires the following Python and PyTorch versions:

- Python >= 3.7
- PyTorch >= 1.7.1 

### Training and Evaulate

quick start:
